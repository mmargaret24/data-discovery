063d27fd-4750-4c2f-a548-aee212006860,Privately Owned Public Open Spaces,"Privately-owned public open spaces (POPOS) are publicly accessible spaces in forms of plazas, terraces, atriums, small parks, and even snippets which are provided and maintained by private developers. In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Prior to 1985, developers provided POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. The 1985 Downtown Plan created the first systemic requirements for developers to provide publicly accessible open space as a part of projects in C-3 Districts. The goal was to “provide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.” (See Planning Code Section 138 for regulations). Since then, project sponsors for residential projects may provide POPOS instead of their required open spaces in the Downtown Residential (DTR) and Eastern Neighborhoods (Section 135 of the Planning Code).

These data were generated to examine the effect of mating delay on life history and reproductive capacity as a cue to the use of mating disruption tactics such as pheromone lures. Survivorship was calculated as the last day egg counts were recorded for an individual. Blocks were adults that were all mated on the same day. Reps are an individual female. Control beetles are coded with either an ""f"" or an ""m"" for female and male and were never mated. Male control data was examined for similarity to female control data but was not used in further analysis and comparison. The experiment was all done at 30C, 65% relative humidity and a 16 light/8 dark photoperiod. Adults were transferred every 2 days to new vials and eggs were then counted and save for progeny counts. Trogoderma variabile populations were laboratory colonies for over 20 years. T. inclusum populations were collected in Kansas in August of 2012.

11d72dfd-9f8b-4a3c-bae3-aab1b302ead4,"Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study","Introduction
   Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.
   Experimental Design
   A suite of vegetation, soils, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments were conducted at three pinyon (Pinyon spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodland study sites in the Great Basin, all of which were historically vegetated as sagebrush shrublands. The collective research is part of a larger study, the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), aimed at evaluating ecological impacts of invasive species and woodland encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems and the effects of various sagebrush restoration practices (www.sagestep.org). Our study sites were selected from the larger SageSTEP study network. Site climatic, topographic, soils, and vegetation characteristics are provided in Table 1. Data collection spanned a 10 year period (2006-2015), with sample years varying by site. Vegetation and ground cover at the sites were sparse when the study initiated in 2006. Various tree-removal treatments (prescribed fire, tree cutting, tree shredding [bullhog]) were applied in late summer and autumn of 2006 at two sites (Marking Corral and Onaqui) to support study of the effectiveness of tree removal in re-establishing sagebrush vegetation and ground cover attributes and in reducing runoff and erosion. Wildfire burned a third site (Castlehead, 2007) before tree-removal treatments could be applied, and, therefore, served as a prescribed natural-fire tree-removal treatment at that site. In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.
   Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.
   The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).
   Methods
   Vegetation and Soil Measurements
   Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs ( 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide × 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm × 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.
   Rainfall Simulations
   Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105°C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).
   Overland Flow Simulations
   Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105°C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).
   Resulting Data
   The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.

In some years at all three sites, a cut-tree (downed tree) was placed across a subset of large-rainfall and overland-flow plot bases within various treatments to evaluate effects of downed trees on runoff and erosion processes. This additional treatment was applied to some plots in cut treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2007 and 2015) and in unburned areas at Castlehead (2008 and 2009). The treatments and experimental design are explained in detail in Pierson et al. (2014, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and treatments at each site by year are shown in Table 2.
   Sampling of various biological and physical attributes at each site was conducted at point, small-rainfall plot (0.5 m2), overland-flow plot (~9 m2), large-rainfall plot (13 m2), and hillslope plot (990 m2) scales. Surface soil texture (0-2 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure in microsites underneath tree canopies (tree coppices) and shrub canopies (shrub coppices) and in interspaces between plants within all treatment areas prior to treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui (2006, 2008) and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead (2008).  Soil bulk density (0-5 cm depth) was sampled as a point measure on tree coppices, shrub coppices, and interspaces at each study site within all treatment areas 1-2 yr following treatments. Vegetation and ground cover were sampled at small-rainfall, large-rainfall, and overland-flow plot scales and at the hillslope scale before and after all treatments at Marking Corral and Onaqui and in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead. Sampling at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots) was conducted to characterize site-level vegetation and ground cover pre-treatment and over time post-treatment. The site characterization plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui prior to treatments in 2006 and left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007) and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Site characterization plots at Castlehead were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots was employed to determine controls on surface hydrology and erosion processes and to characterize treatment effects on cover conditions at those plot scales. Vegetation and ground cover sampling on rainfall simulation and overland flow plots in untreated areas (control and unburned) and treated areas varied by site and year as shown in Table 2.
   The rainfall simulations and overland flow experiments were conducted at the different plot scales to isolate specific runoff and erosion processes (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Rainfall simulations at the small plot scale were applied to quantify runoff and erosion solely by rainsplash and sheetflow (splash-sheet) processes. Each small plot was installed to occur on either a tree coppice, shrub coppice, or interspace microsite as described by Pierson et al. (2010) and Williams et al. (2014). Small plots were installed and sampled in controls and all other treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to tree-removal treatments and were left in place for sampling 1 yr (2007), 2 yr (2008), and 9 yr (2015) post-treatment. Small plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) and left in place for subsequent sampling 2 yr post-fire (2009). Large plot rainfall simulations were employed to quantify runoff and erosion from the combination of splash-sheet and concentrated overland flow processes. Each plot was installed to occur on either a tree zone (tree coppice microsite and area just outside canopy drip line) or a shrub-interspace zone (intercanopy between trees) inclusive shrub coppice and interspace microsites (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Large plots were installed and sampled in all treatment areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 prior to treatments (controls) and were removed following sampling. New plots were installed and sampled in treatment areas at those sites 1 yr post-treatment (2007) and were then removed. At Castlehead, large rainfall plots were installed and sampled in unburned and burned areas 1 yr post-fire (2008) and were then removed. Overland flow simulations at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2006 and 2007 were conducted on large rainfall plots following the rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations were also conducted in control and treated areas at Marking Corral and Onaqui in 2008, but those plots were not subjected to rainfall simulation. Overland flow simulations at Castlehead 1 yr post-fire (2008) were run on large rainfall simulation plots following rainfall simulations and 2 yr post-fire (2009) on newly installed plots without rainfall simulations. Overland flow plots run on large-rainfall simulation plots were bordered on all sides and contained a runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014). Overland flow simulations conducted independent of rainfall-simulation experiments were run on borderless plots with runoff collection trough at the plot base (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).
   Methods
   Vegetation and Soil Measurements
   Detailed explanations of vegetation, ground cover, and soils sampling at each plot scale are provided in Pierson et al. (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and Williams et al. (2014, 2018, 2019) and are briefly summarized here. All trees [HTML_REMOVED] 0.5 m height on each site characterization plot were tallied and measured for tree height and crown diameter. The respective total number of trees and crown diameters were then used to determine live tree density (number per hectare) and canopy cover on each site characterization plot. The number of live shrubs ( 5 cm height) and live tree seedlings (5-50 cm height) on each site characterization plot were quantified using 3 belt transects, 2 m wide × 30 m long. Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type on each site characterization, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot were quantified using line-point intercept methodologies along 5 to 9 transects spanning the full length of the respective plot. Sample point spacing along each transect varied from 10-20 cm (216-295 points/plot) on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and 50 cm (300 points/plot) on site characterization plots (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Ground surface roughness was also quantified on each large-rainfall and overland-flow plot using a survey level line and incremented stadia rod (Pierson et al., 2010). Distances between plant bases (basal gaps) and plant canopies (canopy gaps) in excess of 20 cm were measured along each line-point transect on large-rainfall and overland-flow plots and used to determine the percentage of the sampled transects on each respective plot with gaps in various gap size classes (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Percent foliar and ground cover by cover type and ground surface roughness on small-rainfall plots was quantified using point frame methods with 5-cm × 10-cm grid spacing (105 points/plot) (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). A mean litter depth was derived on each small-rainfall plot based on 4 evenly spaced litter depth measurements along each of two plot edges perpendicular to the hillslope contour. The aggregate stability of the soil surface for each small-rainfall plot was determined immediately prior to rainfall simulation using a modified sieve test (Pierson et al., 2010). Soil water repellency at 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-cm soil depths for each small-rainfall simulation plot was quantified immediately prior to rainfall simulation using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) procedure (Pierson et al., 2010, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Soil moisture was measured for all rainfall simulation and overland flow simulations by gravimetric sample taken immediately prior to the respective simulation (Pierson et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2014). Portions of these samples had to be discarded in various years due to failed seals on soil cans.
   Rainfall Simulations
   Rainfall was applied to small- and large-rainfall plots at target rates of 64 mm h-1 (dry run) and 102 mm h-1 (wet run) for 45 min. The dry run was applied on uniform dry antecedent soil moisture conditions, and the wet run began within 30 min following the dry run. Rainfall was applied to small-rainfall plots using a portable oscillating-arm rainfall simulator fitted with 80-100 Veejet nozzles (Meyer and Harmon, 1979; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). Rainfall was applied to large-rainfall plots using a Colorado State University (CSU) type rainfall simulator (Holland, 1969; Pierson et al. 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014) with stationary sprinklers elevated 3.05 m above the soil surface.  Raindrop size (2 mm) and kinetic energy (200 kJ ha-1 mm-1) of simulated rainfall were within approximately 1 mm and 70 kJ ha-1 mm-1 respectively of values reported for natural convective rainfall (Holland, 1969; Meyer and Harmon, 1979). The total amount of rainfall applied to each small-rainfall plot was obtained by integrating the pan catch of a 5-min calibration run prior to each rainfall simulation. Total applied rainfall was estimated on plots where vegetation prevented placement of calibration pans. Estimated rainfall amount was calculated as the average of all calibrations for the respective simulation date. Total rainfall applied to large-rainfall plots was determined from the average of six plastic depth gages placed on a uniform grid within each plot. Timed samples of small-rainfall and large-rainfall plot runoff were collected at 1-min to 3-min intervals throughout each 45-min simulation and analyzed for runoff volume and sediment concentration. Runoff from direct rainfall on the large-plot collection troughs (trough catch, see Fig. 1) was estimated by sampling collection trough runoff before plot-generated runoff occurred.  Cumulative runoff and sediment were obtained for each runoff sample by weighing the sample before and after drying at 105°C.  Sample weights were adjusted to account for trough catch. A mean runoff rate (mm h-1 and L min-1) was calculated for each sample interval as the interval runoff divided by the interval time. Sediment discharge (g s-1) for each sample interval was derived as the cumulative sediment for the sample interval divided by the interval time. Sediment concentration for each sample interval was calculated by dividing cumulative sediment by cumulative runoff (g L-1). Some field samples were discarded from the final dataset due to laboratory errors or issues identified in the field notes (i.e., spillage, bottle overrun, etc.).
   Overland Flow Simulations
   Computer-controlled flow regulators (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019) were used to apply concentrated flow release rates of 15, 30, and 45 L min-1 to each overland-flow plot. Flow was routed through a metal box filled with Styrofoam pellets, to dissipate kinetic energy, and was released through a 10-cm wide mesh-screened opening at the base of the box (Pierson et al., 2010). Each flow release on each plot was applied for 12 min from the same release-point location, approximately 4 m upslope of the collection trough apex.  Release rate progression was consecutive from 15 L min-1 to 45 L min-1.  Flow samples were collected at varying intervals (commonly 2-min intervals) for each 12-min simulation at each release rate. Flow samples were weighed, oven-dried at 105°C, and then re-weighed to determine runoff rate and sediment concentration. As noted above for rainfall simulation samples, a small number of runoff samples were discarded due to various lab and field issues. Runoff and sediment variables for each release rate were calculated for an 8-min time period beginning at the time of runoff initiation. The 8-min runoff and sediment variables were calculated as described for the 45-min rainfall simulations. The velocity of runoff was measured by releasing a concentrated salt solution into the flow and using electrical conductivity probes to track the mean transit time of the salt over a known flow path length (Pierson et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019). The width, depth, and total rill area width (TRAW) of flowing water were measured along flow cross-sections 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m downslope from the release point. TRAW represents the total width between the outermost edges of the outermost flow paths at the respective cross section (Pierson et al. 2010). Overland flow simulations run on large-rainfall simulation plots (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2006 and 2007, Castlehead - 2008) were conducted approximately two hours after respective rainfall simulations. Overland flow simulations on plots not subjected to rainfall simulation (Marking Corral and Onaqui - 2008, 2015, Castlehead - 2009) were run on soils pre-wet with a gently misting sprinkler (Pierson et al., 2013, 2015; Williams et al., 2014, 2018, 2019).
   Resulting Data
   The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.

15fc449c-5942-4c3c-b65b-09a4f7286441,"Data from: Interspecific variation in persistence of buried weed seeds follows trade-offs among physiological, chemical and physical seed defenses","This dataset includes data on the chemical, physical and biological traits of weed seeds of 11 arable weed species in relation to the persistence of these seeds in the soil seedbank within a common-garden burial study. We performed a common garden weed seed burial study at the University of Illinois Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Savoy, IL (40.048757 N, -88.237206 E), from October 2007 through October 2012. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications of the sub-plot variable species nested within main plot variable burial duration (1 to 5 years). Eleven annual weed species were included, spanning a broad range of seed sizes, dormancy types and seedbank persistence: Abutilon theophrasti Medik (velvetleaf), Ambrosia trifida L. (giant ragweed), Amaranthus tuberculatus [Moq]. Sauer (common waterhemp), Bassia scoparia [L.] A. J. Scott (kochia), Chenopodium album L. (common lambsquarters), Ipomoea hederacea Jacq. (ivyleaf morningglory), Panicum miliaceum L. (wild proso millet), Polygonum pensylvanicum L. (Pennsylvania smartweed), Setaria faberi Herrm. (giant foxtail), Setaria pumila [Poir] Roem. (yellow foxtail) and Thlaspi arvense L. (field pennycress).
   Weed seeds were collected in 2007 from the experimental site and adjoining fields by gently shaking mature inflorescences over a bucket and bulking seeds from multiple plants to form a composite sample for each species. Light seed were removed by processing with a seed cleaner, after which seeds were stored in air tight containers at 4C until burial. Immediately prior to burial, seed viability was assayed with tetrazolium. Burial units consisted of 100 seeds of a given species placed in the bottom of a 2.5 cm deep square tray, 10 cm on a side, made of 0.5 mm stainless steel wire mesh. Tray bottoms were permeable to water, but prevented seeds from escaping. Trays were filled 2 cm deep with soil from a nearby grass sward that had not been cropped for over 30 years, to avoid contamination with weed seeds (verified by elutriating samples of this soil). Within each experimental unit, we excavated a 2 cm deep rectangle 30 cm wide by 40 cm long, and placed trays for each of the 11 species side by side into this depression so that their soil surface was flush with the surrounding soil, leaving a 0.5 cm wire mesh lip exposed in each tray. Each experimental unit was covered by wire mesh with 1 cm square openings to permit access to invertebrate granivores. The study plot was fenced to exclude large vertebrates.
   Seedling emergence was recorded weekly from March through October every year. Seed trays for a given burial duration treatment were removed in October of the assigned year and seeds recovered via elutriation (Wiles et al. 1996). Recovered seeds were incubated under oscillating temperature conditions (15 C/dark for 10 hr, 25 C/light for 14 hr) for 2 weeks and germination recorded. Ungerminated seeds assessed as viable through tetrazolium testing were considered dormant.
   SEED TRAITS
   We measured chemical and physical seed traits on freshly collected seeds following the methods outlined in Tiansawat et al. (2014), using multiple measures of each trait class to provide functional redundancy and allow them to be treated as latent or manifest variables during multivariate analyses. For the chemical defense trait class we measured ortho-dihydroxyphenol (o-DHP) concentration, abundance and diversity of phenolic compounds quantified with high performance liquid chromatography, impact of seed homogenate on brine shrimp survival, and seed removal by invertebrate granivores. Physical traits measured included seed coat thickness, seed mass, and seed coat rupture force. Pairwise interspecific phylogenetic distances were quantified using the phydist subroutine of Phylocom 4.2 (www.phylodiversity.net). Also included is a list of references from the associated literature review.","Data from: Interspecific variation in persistence of buried weed seeds follows trade-offs among physiological, chemical and physical seed defenses (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/15fc449c-5942-4c3c-b65b-09a4f7286441) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",USDA NAL,"[""abutilon-theophrasti"",""amaranthus-tuberculatus"",""ambrosia-trifida"",""annual-weeds"",""artemia"",""bassia-scoparia"",""buried-seeds"",""chemical-defenses"",""chenopodium-album"",""data-collection"",""dormancy"",""germination"",""granivores"",""high-performance-liquid-chromatography"",""illinois"",""inflorescences"",""interspecific-variation"",""ipomoea-hederacea"",""multivariate-analysis"",""np304"",""panicum-miliaceum-subsp-ruderale"",""persicaria-pensylvanica"",""phenolic-compounds"",""seed-coat"",""seed-defense-theory"",""seed-traits"",""seedling-emergence"",""seeds"",""setaria-faberi"",""setaria-pumila-subsp-pumila"",""soil-sampling"",""soil-seedbanks"",""temperature"",""tetrazolium"",""thlaspi-arvense"",""viability"",""weed-management"",""weed-seed-persistence"",""weeds""]","[""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture""]","[""89bfd33c9552f2afa6d4ee12024e535847693c222b3995becdf9edf67f8797b8.application.vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"",""542427d754aa5c7630ce4fb9d0475319770cafe74064c98d3873be704debe53a.text.csv""]",542427d754aa5c7630ce4fb9d0475319770cafe74064c98d3873be704debe53a.text.csv,"['description', 'species', 'description', 'description', 'format', 'position', 'area', 'status', 'album']","['Worksheet', 'Variable name', 'Explanation', 'Applicable Resource(s)', 'Data type', 'Character length', 'Acceptable values', 'Required?', 'Accepts null value?']"

Amid a variety of sources and methods for these data, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s technology development programs determine estimates for use in program planning.

The Transparent Cost Database collects program cost and performance estimates for EERE technologies in a public forum where they can be viewed and compared to other published estimates. The database includes literature on technology cost, performance estimates and levelized costs (both current and future projections) for:

     All data are downloadable for full transparency. 
 

Levelized cost calculation parameters for all three areas can be adjusted and the dynamic results can be downloaded in CSV or as a formatted spreadsheet.

This project is under active development and we welcome user suggestions for additional features or modifications to enhance usability for the energy community. The database also allows nomination of data sets for inclusion in the database or comments on the estimates used by interested users.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.",Census 2010: Blocks for San Francisco (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/1e78689d-9c5a-4cff-ba5c-c0ccffe23ba6) is licensed under PDDL (https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/),data.sfgov.org,[],"[""City of San Francisco"",""City of San Francisco""]","[""c3080ffa851cfca2aa7f16fbedbe2d49f0489e0f1340b7838891926b30193f8f.application.json"",""ce3596adf1f61ce7afc5576e66a442787d23e3157e07a818054a42966bc84125.text.csv""]",ce3596adf1f61ce7afc5576e66a442787d23e3157e07a818054a42966bc84125.text.csv,"['address', 'capacity', 'code', 'day', 'area', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'region', 'region', 'status', 'rank', 'area', 'address', 'address']","['the_geom', 'COUNTYFP10', 'TRACTCE10', 'STATEFP10', 'BLOCKCE10', 'GEOID10', 'NAME10', 'MTFCC10', 'UR10', 'UACE10', 'FUNCSTAT10', 'ALAND10', 'AWATER10', 'INTPTLAT10', 'INTPTLON10']"

What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition?

Measurements are taken at 30cm, 60cm, 90cm, 120cm, 150cm, 180cm, 210cm, 240cm, 270cm, and 300cm when possible or to the greatest depth it was possible to install the access tubing before hitting impenetrable caliche. If fewer depths were measured, the missing depths have a zero in the raw data set of count values. These are changed to ""."" in converted water content data set. Calculated water content values equal to less than zero are changed to zero in converted water content data set. Converted water content values are a volume/volume relationship and represent cm3 water/cm3 soil. Data from neutron probe data logger is dumped to disk. Raw count data is then converted to water content using a Fortran program called WC2.FOR (water content for LTER-II). Water content data is then sorted by i.d. number using a LOTUS 123 macro found in WC2_SORT.WQ1 which creates final version of water content data set for the month in a separate file. Two files per month are saved: raw count data (mmddyy-2.RAW; ex. 121189-2.RAW where -2 indicates LTER-II NPP site neutron probe readings) and calculated/ sorted soil water content data appended to data file containing that year's data (NPPSWCyy.DAT; example NPPSWC89.DAT contains NPP soil water content data for 1989). Regression equation was derived by Mahlia Nash, and after datalogger upgrade was added to hydroprobe, by David Hudson, both working for Dr. Peter Wierenga (as of 1994 at university at Tucson (Hudson's phone # is 602-621-3236). See PROBE.HIS file for probe history and regressions used for different data periods when different probes were used. The hydroprobe used whenever possible is Hydroprobe Model CPN503DR (Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Pacheco, CA) with data logger. This probe has a 50mCi241 Am-Be source and a hydrogen detector. Neutrons encountering hydrogen become thermalized. The detector totals returning thermalized neutrons over a 16 second sample time which is the raw count value displayed. The raw count value is then substituted into the proper regression equation for cm3 of water per cm3 of soil.",NPP Soil Water Content (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2648d49a-70f3-4fa4-9e18-00682586af0f) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),USDA NAL,"[""biota"",""climatologymeteorologyatmosphere"",""environment"",""farming"",""geoscientificinformation"",""iso-metadata"",""np216""]",Department of Agriculture,6c5dfb9be1e4d8e479f9fdd228aa688910d037c0e9f4f3cf6076ebeded8bc924.text.csv,6c5dfb9be1e4d8e479f9fdd228aa688910d037c0e9f4f3cf6076ebeded8bc924.text.csv,[],[]

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",My Brother's Keeper Key Statistical Indicators on Boys and Men of Color

In addition, the typology will inform neighborhood level planning efforts and provide residents with an understanding of the local housing market conditions in their communities. Regional Choice: Competitive housing markets with high owner-occupancy rates and high property values in comparison to all other market types. Foreclosure, vacancy and abandonment rates are low.  Middle Market Choice: Housing prices above the city��_��s average with strong ownership rates, and low vacancies, but with slightly increased foreclosure rates.  Middle Market:  Median sales values of $91,000 (above the City��_��s average of $65,000) as well as high homeownership rates. These markets experienced higher foreclosure rates when compared to higher value markets, with slight population loss.  Middle Market Stressed: Slightly lower home sale values than the City��_��s average, and have not shown significant sales price appreciation. Vacancies and foreclosure rates are high, and the rate of population loss has increased in this market type, according to the 2010 Census data.  Distressed Market: , Have experienced significant deterioration of the housing stock.

Bathymetric and sidescan-sonar data, originally collected by NOAA for charting purposes, provide a framework for research and management activities along western Block Island Sound, show the composition and terrain of the seabed, and provide information on sediment transport and benthic habitat.

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.
   Note:
   This table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

3c1d0adb-f669-4794-a372-079e1332c6db,"Nearshore bathymetry of the Columbia River littoral cell, Washington and Oregon, 2017","This portion of the USGS data release presents bathymetry data collected during surveys performed in the Columbia River littoral cell, Washington and Oregon in 2017 (USGS Field Activity Number 2017-666-FA). Bathymetry data were collected using four personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The sonar systems consisted of an Odom Echotrac CV-100 single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 9 degree beam angle. Raw acoustic backscatter returns were digitized by the echosounder with a vertical resolution of 1.25 cm. Depths from the echosounders were computed using sound velocity profiles measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessels was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using Trimble R7 GNSS receivers. Output from the GNSS receivers and sonar systems were combined in real time on the PWC by a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing PWC operators to navigate along survey lines at speeds of 2 to 3 m/s. Survey-grade positions of the PWCs were achieved with a single-base station and differential post-processing. Positioning data from the GNSS receivers were post-processed using Waypoint Grafnav to apply differential corrections from a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. Bathymetric data were merged with post-processed positioning data and spurious soundings were removed using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) programmed with the computer program MATLAB. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 10 cm. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system.","Nearshore bathymetry of the Columbia River littoral cell, Washington and Oregon, 2017 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/3c1d0adb-f669-4794-a372-079e1332c6db) is licensed under U.S. Government Work (http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/)",,"[""gps (global positioning system)"",""pacific ocean"",""single-beam echo sounder"",""columbia river"",""gps measurement"",""global positioning system (gps) observations"",""coastal and marine hazards and resources program"",""bathymetry"",""grays harbor county"",""water depth"",""cmhrp"",""u.s. geological survey"",""bathymetry and elevation"",""pacific coastal and marine science center"",""bathymetry measurement"",""clatsop county"",""echo sounders"",""pacific county"",""usgs"",""pcmsc""]","[""Department of the Interior"",""Department of the Interior""]","[""133af6b910c4eb38144ae429b94c66cd976b4b53aadccca70520799864354f00.text.csv"",""133af6b910c4eb38144ae429b94c66cd976b4b53aadccca70520799864354f00.text.csv""]",133af6b910c4eb38144ae429b94c66cd976b4b53aadccca70520799864354f00.text.csv,"['location', 'weight', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'depth', 'weight', 'address', 'depth']","['area', 'line_number', 'datetime_utc', 'longitude', 'latitude', 'easting_m', 'northing_m', 'distance_m', 'offline_m', 'ellipsoid_ht_m', 'ortho_ht_m']"

3e23114a-2657-4880-8add-f3c24425f937,NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States,"This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.
   Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).
   Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.
   Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.
   Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.
   Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).",NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/3e23114a-2657-4880-8add-f3c24425f937) is licensed under U.S. Government Work (http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/),Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"[""deaths"",""drug-poisoning"",""mortality"",""national"",""nchs"",""state"",""united-states""]","[""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"",""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"",""U.S. Department of Health & Human Services""]","[""96d9e5a78eebee7d90ece4728842fc84eb4e55cd65391dd05a6a23da0f8a6553.text.csv"",""7db165093295649c30030712fcc13bebe78b8c1982eccd41834768d0537713ad.application.rdf+xml"",""1b26ec5eae75eade2fc9df3dd97d95d796c2ac5b82c7b3fa6173bd9d7cd9b75b.application.json""]",96d9e5a78eebee7d90ece4728842fc84eb4e55cd65391dd05a6a23da0f8a6553.text.csv,"['year', 'sex', 'age', 'area', 'state', 'rank', 'address', 'duration', 'weight', 'age', 'age', 'area', 'area', 'ranking', 'area', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth']","['Year', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Race and Hispanic Origin', 'State', 'Deaths', 'Population', 'Crude Death Rate', 'Standard Error for Crude Rate', 'Low Confidence Limit for Crude Rate', 'Upper Confidence Limit for Crude Rate', 'Age-adjusted Rate', 'Standard Error Age-adjusted Rate', 'Lower Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted rate', 'Upper Confidence Limit for Age-adjusted Rate', 'State Crude Rate in Range', 'US Crude Rate', 'US Age-adjusted Rate']"

   In this Table, all conditions with a 5-year average annual national total of more than or equals 1,000 cases but less than or equals 10,000 cases will be displayed (≥ 1,000 and ≤ 10,000). The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.
   Note:
   These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.
   Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.
   Footnotes:
   C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
   U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum.
   * Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesS.... Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.
   † Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as [HTML_REMOVED] 5 years. Since 2010, case notifications for this condition were consolidated under one event code for Invasive pneumococcal disease.

   Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.
   Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause of death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

However, these communities reflect only a subset of the biodiversity of grassland systems. We conducted a multi-trophic study to assess ecosystem recovery following energy development for oil and gas extraction in northern U.S. Great Plains rangelands. We compared soil factors, plant species composition and cover, and nematode trophic structuring between reclaimed oil and gas well sites (""reclaims"") that comprise a chronosequence of two – 33 years since reclamation and adjacent, undeveloped rangeland at distances of 50 m and 150 m from reclaim edges. Soils and plant communities in reclaims did not match those on undeveloped rangeland even after 33 years. Reclaimed soils had higher salt concentrations and pH than undeveloped soils. Reclaims had lower overall plant cover, a greater proportion of exotic and ruderal plant cover and lower native plant species richness than undeveloped rangeland. However, nematode communities appear to have recovered following reclamation. Although total and omni-carnivorous nematode abundances differed between reclaimed well sites and undeveloped rangeland, community composition and structure did not. These findings suggest that current reclamation practices recover the functional composition of nematode communities, but not soil conditions or plant communities.

Tracking sodium levels of ~125 popular foods, called ""Sentinel Foods,"" by periodically sampling them at stores and restaurants around the country, followed by laboratory analyses.
   Tracking levels of ""related"" nutrients that could change when manufacturers reformulate their foods to reduce sodium; these related nutrients are potassium, total and saturated fat, total dietary fiber, and total sugar.
   Sharing the results of these monitoring activities to the public periodically in the Sodium Monitoring Dataset and USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and once every two years in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies.

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.
   Note:
   This table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

44949183-b50f-4498-999c-51be4429102a,Data from: Identifying Critical Life Stage Transitions for Biological Control of Long-lived Perennial Vincetoxicum Species,"This dataset includes data on 25 transitions of a matrix demographic model of the invasive species Vincetoxicum nigrum (L.) Moench (black swallow-wort or black dog-strangling vine) and Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barb. (pale swallow-wort or dog-strangling vine) (Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae), two invasive perennial vines in the northeastern U.S.A. and southeastern Canada. The matrix model was developed for projecting population growth rates as a result of changes to lower-level vital rates from biological control although the model is generalizable to any control tactic. Transitions occurred among the five life stages of seeds, seedlings, vegetative juveniles (defined as being in at least their second season of growth), small flowering plants (having 1–2 stems), and large flowering plants (having 3 or more stems). Transition values were calculated using deterministic equations and data from 20 lower-level vital rates collected from 2009-2012 from two open field and two forest understory populations of V. rossicum (43°51’N, 76°17’W; 42°48'N, 76°40'W) and two open field populations of V. nigrum (41°46’N, 73°44’W; 41°18’N, 73°58’W) in New York State. Sites varied in plant densities, soil depth, and light levels (forest populations). Detailed descriptions of vital rate data collection may be found in: Milbrath et al. 2017. Northeastern Naturalist 24(1):37-53. Five replicate sets of transition data obtained from five separate spatial regions of a particular infestation were produced for each of the six populations.

In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.

54afaa55-753c-4b2e-a956-986b74598fdc,Data from: Ploidy determination of buffel grass accessions in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System collection by flow cytometry,"Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn. Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) is an economically important warm-season perennial used primarily as a forage and range grass in many of the drier regions throughout the subtropics and tropics. Because buffel grass has excellent drought tolerance combined with desirable forage traits, it is an important forage and range grass in parts of Africa, including South Africa. It was introduced into many of the arid subtropical regions of the world, primarily Australia, North America, and South America, and today the species is grown on more than 50 million ha worldwide. Knowledge of the ploidy, meiotic behavior, and fertility of the plants used in hybridization programs became important because success depended upon using meiotically stable parental lines with compatible chromosome numbers. Little is known about the chromosome number of the buffel grass accessions in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) because the species has small chromosomes, that makes them difficult to count using traditional cytological methods. The DNA content of 568 accessions of buffel grass in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System was determined through flow cytometry to predict their ploidy levels. Based on DNA content, 308 accessions were determined as tetraploids with 36 chromosomes, 139 as pentaploids with 45 chromosomes, 20 as hexaploids with 54 chromosomes, two as septaploids with 63 chromosomes, and 99 as aneuploids. Chromosome counts of selected plants confirmed ploidy levels from DNA findings. Chromosome number of euploid plants could be predicted from the DNA data.
   The findings from this investigation reveal that the accessions in the buffel grass collection consist of a wide range of cytotypes, including polyploids and aneuploids with varying chromosome numbers.

Hepatitis C, perinatal infection to Influenza-associated pediatric mortality - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
 Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_fi....

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals, users also can find ""agricultural normals"", which are used in many industries, including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These supplemental ""agricultural normals"" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds, and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",U.S. Monthly Climate Normals (1981-2010) (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/5ef09f08-4f83-4208-bb8e-a7083a5a7e98) is licensed under U.S. Government Work (http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/),,"[""atmosphere"",""united states of america"",""north america"",""national centers for environmental information"",""nesdis"",""noaa"",""u.s. department of commerce"",""doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei"",""agriculture"",""continent"",""earth science"",""vertical location"",""point resolution"",""doc/noaa/nesdis/ncdc"",""land surface"",""maximum/minimum temperature"",""precipitation amount"",""atmospheric temperature"",""puerto rico"",""virgin islands"",""freeze/frost"",""degree days"",""thermometers"",""temperature anomalies"",""liquid precipitation"",""national climatic data center"",""nesdis"",""noaa"",""u.s. department of commerce"",""frost"",""rain"",""weather events"",""precipitation"",""atmospheric phenomena"",""surface temperature"",""rain gauges"",""precipitation anomalies"",""meteorological stations""]","[""National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce"",""National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce"",""National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce""]","[""3f98dbaae4742e4c359f511896dfcfedb776358b4bc289e9a7fd4548a0201a63.application.pdf"",""9fadccf382a4200f21511d66445b3e46c4c767c6e360c470101db735bcc99d21.application.pdf"",""b5ed0a7910b640af0ac1ee29c9f500de72a910ccd12a284bd404674946769b55.text.csv""]",b5ed0a7910b640af0ac1ee29c9f500de72a910ccd12a284bd404674946769b55.text.csv,"['address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'region', 'plays', 'rank']","['STATION', 'STATION_NAME', 'ELEVATION', 'LATITUDE', 'LONGITUDE', 'DATE', 'MLY-TMIN-NORMAL', 'MLY-TMAX-NORMAL', 'MLY-PRCP-NORMAL']"

Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

This on-going inventory process will help us to categorize and identify data that could be made publicly available. This process also assists our ability to work cross-departmentally and increases our resilience.

Why is the data inventory important? 
   •   Stimulate new ideas and services. By publishing a data inventory, city departments may help to stimulate new and innovative ideas from the community. 
   •   Increase internal sharing and resilience. A data inventory can also help us access information from other departments that we need to improve service delivery and resilience planning. 
   •   Enabling better and more up-to-date processes. The process of publishing a data inventory will help us to realize the constraints of current City technology and processes, and then plan for future improvements. 
   •   Changing how we use data. A data inventory can help empower us to change how we use, share and consume our data externally and internally, ultimately transforming data into better services for citizens and fostering continuous improvement.",City Data Inventory (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/6cf7ce33-f965-44ac-89d0-35e42c73f575) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),data.nola.gov,"[""city-data"",""city-of-new-orleans"",""data"",""inventory"",""open-data""]","[""City of New Orleans"",""City of New Orleans"",""City of New Orleans"",""City of New Orleans""]","[""6e6d386416e59c08d42ac9590f98b0d73b8c4ca19721c2a7142f8881204892e2.text.csv"",""2d047b38b187aea3718e870afe027ff838bf2c7f549d34ed90fb763f9e9a29d9.application.rdf+xml"",""04ae1596851006e4aaf046eb21c39f249ecf98b5039aee0960688aa079668b10.application.json"",""2058288706af3262d6641332e10ab3367e521012aef9461b6fecd48c8080d0be.text.xml""]",6e6d386416e59c08d42ac9590f98b0d73b8c4ca19721c2a7142f8881204892e2.text.csv,"['category', 'description', 'description', 'name', 'description', 'year', 'area', 'description', 'category', 'format', 'class', 'result', 'category', 'duration', 'category', 'region', 'area', 'category', 'gender', 'gender', 'category', 'sales', 'result', 'category', 'category', 'category', 'age', 'area']","['Department', 'Dataset', 'Description', 'Data steward', 'Data Source', 'Start Date', 'End Date', 'Geographic granularity', 'Frequency of  Data Change', 'Data source format', 'Is Published?', 'Open Data Link', 'Completeness', 'Accuracy', 'Real-time Data Updates', 'Data Quality  Score', 'Data Quality Grade', 'Data Classification', 'Interest (Perceived Value) Level', 'Supports City Program or Project (e.g. Workforce Development, Equity)', ""Increases gov't transparency & accountability"", 'Open Data Score', 'Open Data Grade', 'Automated', 'Delivery Cost', 'Maintenance Cost', 'Cost Score', 'Cost Grade']"

Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

74df254d-193e-4de7-aaf4-0d5f5b306e84,Education and Youth (2010-2013),"BNIA-JFI tracks twenty seven indicators for elementary, middle, and high school students in an effort to measure the educational performance and youth engagement in Baltimore City. These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.",Education and Youth (2010-2013) (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/74df254d-193e-4de7-aaf4-0d5f5b306e84) is licensed under CC BY 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/),data.baltimorecity.gov,"[""bnia"",""education""]","[""City of Baltimore"",""City of Baltimore"",""City of Baltimore"",""City of Baltimore""]","[""ffbc503eff0cd5fd10b7c092d7427bd17d8c16c18ce19a3e77134ef1c66a10ac.text.csv"",""1ce45dd4cdf6810504724d88b8d1676ae8d37c2bf956251cb1b75d31f3099c1a.application.rdf+xml"",""81c181075a282e81043ab710c751a4720642be5324c660276afe83644def821b.application.json"",""df3301fcc2cc75b0c37d135cac9051007e7e750c33a21dbe1f43526f150ce6eb.text.xml""]",ffbc503eff0cd5fd10b7c092d7427bd17d8c16c18ce19a3e77134ef1c66a10ac.text.csv,"['area', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'plays', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'plays', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'rank', 'range', 'weight', 'range', 'range', 'age', 'result', 'weight', 'weight', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'age', 'age', 'weight', 'age', 'depth', 'weight', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'depth', 'depth', 'age', 'age', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'age', 'depth', 'ranking', 'weight', 'weight', 'depth', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'depth', 'depth', 'depth', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'ranking', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'weight', 'depth', 'rank', 'rank', 'age', 'education', 'education', 'rank']","['Neighborhood', 'eattend10', 'eattend11', 'eattend12', 'eattend13', 'mattend10', 'mattend11', 'mattend12', 'mattend13', 'hsattend10', 'hsattend11', 'hsattend12', 'hsattend13', 'eenrol11', 'eenrol12', 'eenrol13', 'menrol11', 'menrol12', 'menrol13', 'hsenrol11', 'hsenrol12', 'hsenrol13', 'aastud10', 'aastud11', 'aastud12', 'aastud13', 'wstud10', 'wstud11', 'wstud12', 'wstud13', 'hstud10', 'hstud11', 'hstud12', 'hstud13', 'abse10', 'abse11', 'abse12', 'abse13', 'absmd10', 'absmd11', 'absmd12', 'absmd13', 'abshs10', 'abshs11', 'abshs12', 'abshs13', 'susp10', 'susp11', 'susp12', 'susp13', 'farms10', 'farms11', 'farms12', 'farms13', 'sped10', 'sped11', 'sped12', 'sped13', 'ready11', 'ready12', 'ready13', 'math310', 'math311', 'math312', 'math313', 'read310', 'read311', 'read312', 'read313', 'math510', 'math511', 'math512', 'math513', 'read510', 'read511', 'read512', 'read513', 'math810', 'math811', 'math812', 'math813', 'read810', 'read811', 'read812', 'read813', 'hsaeng10', 'hsaeng11', 'hsaeng12', 'hsaeng13', 'hsabio10', 'hsabio11', 'hsabio12', 'hsabio13', 'hsagov10', 'hsagov11', 'hsagov13', 'hsaalg10', 'hsaalg11', 'hsaalg12', 'hsaalg13', 'drop10', 'drop11', 'drop12', 'drop13', 'compl10', 'compl11', 'compl12', 'compl13', 'sclsw11', 'sclsw12', 'sclsw13', 'sclemp13']"

   Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. This 20-yr-long effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.
   The data set contains concentration, load, and daily discharge data for Devils Icebox Cave and Hunters Cave from 1999 to 2002. The data are available in Microsoft Excel 2010 format. Sheet 1 (Cave Streams Metadata) contains supporting information regarding the length of record, site locations, parameters measured, parameter units, method detection limits, describes the meaning of zero and blank cells, and briefly describes unit area load computations. Sheet 2 (Devils Icebox Concentration Data) contains concentration data from all samples collected from 1999 to 2002 at the Devils Icebox site for 12 analytes and two computed nutrient parameters. Sheet 3 (Devils Icebox SS Conc Data) contains 15-minute suspended sediment (SS) concentrations estimated from turbidity sensor data for the Devils Icebox site. Sheet 4 (Devils Icebox Load & Discharge Data) contains daily data for discharge, load, and unit area loads for the Devils Icebox site. Sheet 5 (Hunters Cave Concentration Data) contains concentration data from all samples collected from 1999 to 2002 at the Hunters Cave site for 12 analytes and two computed nutrient parameters. Sheet 6 (Hunters Cave SS Conc Data) contains 15-minute SS concentrations estimated from turbidity sensor data for the Hunters Cave site. Sheet 7 (Hunters Cave Load & Discharge Data) contains daily data for discharge, load, and unit area loads for the Hunters Cave site.

Arboviral diseases, neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive,  St. Louis encephalitis virus disease to Western equine encephalitis virus disease - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

Differences in host specificity did not correlate with geographical distances among parasitoid populations, suggesting that local adaption is mosaic rather than clinal, with a spatial scale of less than 50 kilometers.

In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

It was an ancillary study to the Delta Healthy Sprouts Project and therefore included towns and neighborhoods in which Delta Healthy Sprouts participants resided.  The 12 towns were located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.  Data were collected via electronic surveys between August 2016 and September 2017 using the Rural Active Living Assessment (RALA) tools and the Community Park Audit Tool (CPAT).  Scale scores for the RALA Programs and Policies Assessment and the Town-Wide Assessment were computed using the scoring algorithms provided for these tools via SAS software programming.  The Street Segment Assessment and CPAT do not have associated scoring algorithms and therefore no scores are provided for them.  Because the towns were not randomly selected and the sample size is small, the data may not be generalizable to all rural towns in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.
   Note:
   These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.
   Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.
   Note:
   This table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.

Surface sediment was collected from 70 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler from the R/V Frontier on July 28, 2015. An additional 17 sediment samples were collected between July 22 and August 23, 2015 by scuba divers. Forty-eight sediment samples were collected at low tide using a push corer at intertidal locations on the delta. The locations of grab samples and intertidal samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Samples obtained by divers were collected adjacent to fixed monuments on the seabed with previously determined coordinates. The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab.

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.
   Note:
   These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.
   Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

   Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.
   Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.

   Pyrosequencing was performed on adult males and females, eggs, and gut and ovary tissues from adult females derived from samples of R. microplus collected during outbreaks in southern Texas. Raw data from bTEFAP were screened and trimmed based upon quality scores and binned into individual sample collections. Bacteria identified to the species level include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Serratia marcescens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Finegoldia magna. One hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues sampled. The total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised: 53 in adult males, 61 in adult females, 11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. Notable genera detected in the cattle tick include Wolbachia, Coxiella, and Borrelia. The molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota associated with R. microplus.
   Ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals. The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where it is endemic.

93f697ba-b63a-46cd-8132-006e075e21e9,Speed Limits,"A. SUMMARY Maximum speed limits per street segment for the City of San Francisco. Speed limits are indicated primarily for streets that have speeds greater than 25 MPH, unless the speed limit has been changed from a higher speed or a speed survey has been conducted to enforce the de facto speed limit of 25 MPH. 25 MPH is the de fact speed limit for most residential and commercial streets, and apply to streets on this map denoted by a 0 MPH label. Alleys narrower than 25 feet can have de facto speed limits of 15 MPH. 

B. METHODOLOGY  Speed limit legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation and in some cases directives from engineers in the 5212 classification. Speed limit implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for speed limits will specify when signs are put in stating the new speed limits, and the work order that the sign installation was spec'd in.

Managed by the Planning Section, BikeBaltimore includes anything bike related including implementing the Bicycle Master Plan, incorporating cycling in many transportation projects, installing bike racks and coordinating cycling events. The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5��_�� wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can ��_��_��_take the lane��_��. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5��_�� bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, ��_��_��_SHARE THE ROAD��_�� signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present.

a2d6bd1c-d449-400a-98ff-e8a66f953a58,Rainfall simulation experiments in the Southwestern USA using the Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator,"Introduction
   Preservation and management of semi-arid ecosystems requires understanding of the processes involved in soil erosion and their interaction with plant community. Rainfall simulations on natural plots provide an effective way of obtaining a large amount of erosion data under controlled conditions in a short period of time. This dataset contains hydrological (rainfall, runoff, flow velocity), erosion (sediment concentration and rate), vegetation (plant cover), and other supplementary information from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada between 2002 and 2013. The dataset advances our understanding of basic hydrological and biological processes that drive soil erosion on arid rangelands. It can be used to quantify runoff, infiltration, and erosion rates on a variety of ecological sites in the Southwestern USA. Inclusion of wildfire and brush treatment locations combined with long term observations makes it important for studying vegetation recovery, ecological transitions, and effect of management. It is also a valuable resource for erosion model parameterization and validation.
   Instrumentation
   Rainfall was generated by a portable, computer-controlled, variable intensity simulator (Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator). The WGRS can deliver rainfall rates ranging between 13 and 178 mm/h with variability coefficient of 11% across 2 by 6.1 m area. Estimated kinetic energy of simulated rainfall was 204 kJ/ha/mm and drop size ranged from 0.288 to 7.2 mm. Detailed description and design of the simulator is available in Stone and Paige (2003). Prior to each field season the simulator was calibrated over a range of intensities using a set of 56 rain gages. During the experiments windbreaks were setup around the simulator to minimize the effect of wind on rain distribution. On some of the plots, in addition to rainfall only treatment, run-on flow was applied at the top edge of the plot. The purpose of run-on water application was to simulate hydrological processes that occur on longer slopes ([HTML_REMOVED]6 m) where upper portion of the slope contributes runoff onto the lower portion.
   Runoff rate from the plot was measured using a calibrated V-shaped supercritical flume equipped with depth gage. Overland flow velocity on the plots was measured using electrolyte and fluorescent dye solution. Dye moving from the application point at 3.2 m distance to the outlet was timed with stopwatch. Electrolyte transport in the flow was measured by resistivity sensors imbedded in edge of the outlet flume. Maximum flow velocity was defined as velocity of the leading edge of the solution and was determined from beginning of the electrolyte breakthrough curve and verified by visual observation (dye). Mean flow velocity was calculated using mean travel time obtained from the electrolyte solution breakthrough curve using moment equation.
   Soil loss from the plots was determined from runoff samples collected during each run. Sampling interval was variable and aimed to represent rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph, any changes in runoff rate, and steady state conditions. This resulted in approximately 30 to 50 samples per simulation.
   Shortly before every simulation plot surface and vegetative cover was measured at 400 point grid using a laser and line-point intercept procedure (Herrick et al., 2005). Vegetative cover was classified as forbs, grass, and shrub. Surface cover was characterized as rock, litter, plant basal area, and bare soil. These 4 metrics were further classified as protected (located under plant canopy) and unprotected (not covered by the canopy). In addition, plant canopy and basal area gaps were measured on the plots over three lengthwise and six crosswise transects.
   Experimental procedure
   Four to eight 6.1 m by 2 m replicated rainfall simulation plots were established on each site. The plots were bound by sheet metal borders hammered into the ground on three sides. On the down slope side a collection trough was installed to channel runoff into the measuring flume. If a site was revisited, repeat simulations were always conducted on the same long term plots.
   The experimental procedure was as follows. First, the plot was subjected to 45 min, 65 mm/h intensity simulated rainfall (dry run) intended to create initial saturated condition that could be replicated across all sites. This was followed by a 45 minute pause and a second simulation with varying intensity (wet run). During wet runs two modes of water application were used as: rainfall or run-on. Rainfall wet runs typically consisted of series of application rates (65, 100, 125, 150, and 180 mm/h) that were increased after runoff had reached steady state for at least five minutes. Runoff samples were collected on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph and during each steady state (a minimum of 3 samples). Overland flow velocities were measured during each steady state as previously described. When used, run-on wet runs followed the same procedure as rainfall runs, except water application rates varied between 100 and 300 mm/h. In approximately 20% of simulation experiments the wet run was followed by another simulation (wet2 run) after a 45 min pause. Wet2 runs were similar to wet runs and also consisted of series of varying intensity rainfalls and/or run-on inputs.

PLSS townships DO NOT have given names. Civil townships, as mentioned previously are governmental entities established by the residents of that township. They can have town boards, town assessors, town clerks, their own maintained roads, etc. They are essentially a governmental sub-division of a county. Many times these townships correspond with PLSS townships. Many times they don’t. Most, if not all, of these townships have established names such as the Town of Almond, or the Town of Rose, or the Town of Rome. There are also many areas that are unorganized, meaning that no civil township government structure is in place. There may have been one there at one time, but maybe the residents chose to disband their local government, or maybe the population could no longer support it. Or maybe one was never formed. In either of these cases, the county usually takes over the local governmental issues

This discrepancy indicates a significant gap in our mechanistic understanding of carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems. Recent research suggests that certain drivers of decomposition that are often not explicitly incorporated into models (e.g., photodegradation and soil-litter mixing; SLM) may be important in drylands, and their exclusion may, in part, be responsible for model under-predictions. To assess the role of SLM, litterbags were deployed in the Chihuahuan Desert and interrelationships between vegetation structure, SLM, and rates of decomposition were quantified. Vegetation structure was manipulated to simulate losses of grass cover from livestock grazing and shrub encroachment. I hypothesized that reductions in grass cover would promote SLM and accelerate mass loss by improving conditions for microbial decomposition.     For more see: Hewins, D. B., S. R. Archer, G. S.

a902386c-60be-48f5-a67b-f945026389fa,Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species considered for introduction to control Diuraphis noxia,"Diuraphis noxia, the Russian wheat aphid, has become a major pest of wheat and barley since first being detected in the western USA in 1986. However, it is rarely a pest in Eurasia, its area of origin, and research has shown that natural enemies can limit its abundance there. Among the most important of natural enemies of D. noxia in Eurasia are parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus. These data are results of laboratory experiments on host specificity of ten populations of seven species from two species complexes in the genus Aphelinus. Host specificity was not related to host plant species or the phylogenetic relatedness of the aphids or the parasitoids. While some species had very broad host ranges and others had intermediate host ranges, Aphelinus hordei had a very narrow host range, being restricted primarily to species in the genus Diuraphis, and especially D. noxia. We also report the results of experiments on the mechanisms of this host specificity. Most of the host specificity of A. hordei can be explained by differences in the behavior of females when they encountered different aphid species. Females of A. hordei rarely approach, sting, oviposit or host feed on aphids outside the genus Diuraphis, and they oviposit most frequently in D. noxia. From these results, we conclude that A. hordei is an excellent candidate for introduction into the USA to control D. noxia.",Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species considered for introduction to control Diuraphis noxia (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/a902386c-60be-48f5-a67b-f945026389fa) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),USDA NAL,"[""aphelinus-asychis-complex"",""aphelinus-hordei"",""aphelinus-varipes-complex"",""biological-control"",""np304"",""russian-wheat-aphid""]","[""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture""]","[""c5fedf07532320fed151755c432e71cb2f82555dfd52fe6e96fc8084f91e9fe4.text.csv"",""47c54fc60f13a7d42f126343076c7b6650789473c17b6fde68b1b9d0c4a67a60.text.csv"",""5f70985114e8e4f0f1f72092cd8e54fa70bf02fe01f5e40c2fb13fdc98a99821.text.csv"",""1fc0e1aa3497fca0c5696740003b6ec779d41ab960ce1b1f318e9c66f06ab6c0.text.csv"",""a0bce00fb9e2053cd8878bb4be18f384ef527a41579e37b6bcb306397d66e9bd.text.csv"",""4bd98bae81e162aac6cbbf0ef38b2e58005dce062d571ebf5c117ab33541d159.text.csv"",""dad0a1c33daaf114b154c0c27339e6ef45264e1261cd6a61a951287dcb7f3674.text.csv""]",a0bce00fb9e2053cd8878bb4be18f384ef527a41579e37b6bcb306397d66e9bd.text.csv,"['address', 'country', 'team', 'year', 'address', 'address', 'rank', 'rank', 'position', 'artist', 'description', 'sex', 'address', 'duration', 'education', 'duration', 'duration', 'duration', 'rank', 'plays', 'plays', 'education', 'status', 'duration', 'sales', 'plays', 'plays', 'rank', 'age', 'plays', 'rank', 'region', 'rank', 'rank', 'position', 'plays']","['species', 'country', 'population', 'year', 'orghost', 'sourceid', 'subpop', 'block', 'location', 'exphost', 'aphid_treat', 'age', 'date', 'time_preexp', 'nhf_preexp', 'time_aphid', 'timein', 'timeout', 'obs_time', 'leave_time', 'flit', 'naphids', 'nappr', 'nstung', 'nhf', 'naphids_diss', 'neggs_aphids', 'neggs_wasp', 'novar', 'naphids_rear', 'nmum', 'naphids_surv', 'nemer', 'nadults', 'nmales', 'nfamles']"

Bathymetry data were collected using four personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The sonar systems consisted of an Odom Echotrac CV-100 single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 9° beam angle. Raw acoustic backscatter returns were digitized by the echosounder with a vertical resolution of 1.25 cm. Depths from the echosounders were computed using sound velocity profiles measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessels was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using Trimble R7 GNSS receivers. Output from the GNSS receivers and sonar systems were combined in real time on the PWC by a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing PWC operators to navigate along survey lines at speeds of 23 m/s. Survey-grade positions of the PWCs were achieved with a single-base station and differential post-processing. Positioning data from the GNSS receivers were post-processed using Waypoint Grafnav to apply differential corrections from a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. Bathymetric data were merged with post-processed positioning data and spurious soundings were removed using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) programmed with the computer program MATLAB. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 10 cm. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system.","Nearshore bathymetry of the Columbia River littoral cell, Washington and Oregon, 2014 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ae4af3ce-19d5-4037-9652-45fa6071d492) is licensed under U.S. Government Work (http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/)",,"[""gps (global positioning system)"",""pacific ocean"",""single-beam echo sounder"",""columbia river"",""gps measurement"",""global positioning system (gps) observations"",""coastal and marine hazards and resources program"",""bathymetry"",""grays harbor county"",""water depth"",""cmhrp"",""u.s. geological survey"",""bathymetry and elevation"",""pacific coastal and marine science center"",""bathymetry measurement"",""clatsop county"",""echo sounders"",""pacific county"",""usgs"",""pcmsc""]","[""Department of the Interior"",""Department of the Interior""]","[""9ba053fb90fbc719d80d91793723252555e0863c5c7280294a39f08023192537.text.csv"",""9ba053fb90fbc719d80d91793723252555e0863c5c7280294a39f08023192537.text.csv""]",9ba053fb90fbc719d80d91793723252555e0863c5c7280294a39f08023192537.text.csv,"['location', 'weight', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'depth', 'name', 'address', 'depth']","['area', 'line_number', 'datetime_utc', 'longitude', 'latitude', 'easting_m', 'northing_m', 'distance_m', 'offline_m', 'ellipsoid_ht_m', 'ortho_ht_m']"

The dataset was updated in April 2018 and represents a snapshot of the K-12 school locations for the 2017-2018 school year. The dataset geometry was derived from the latitude and longitude coordinates of each school, but a majority of the points were adjusted and moved on top of the school buildings using aerial imagery as a reference. Esri's 2018 aerial imagery was used along with Google Maps to determine the locations of the school buildings. A scale of 1:2,400 was used as a reference when placing points on top of the school buildings.

In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_fi....

be168ca7-07d5-4795-ae62-6c8e8c4a1cde,Inventory of online public databases and repositories holding agricultural data in 2017,"United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.
   Purpose
   As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.
   An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to

establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals
   compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms
   determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data
   ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data

Approach
   The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.
   Search methods
   We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of “agricultural data” /“ag data” / “scientific data” + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.
   We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of “agriculture”, “ag data” and “university” to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University – International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis – Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.
   Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.
   Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.
   Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.
   Evaluation
   We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.
   We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.
   Results
   A summary of the major findings from our data review:

Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.
   There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.

Anthrax to Arboviral diseases, Eastern equine encephalitis virus disease - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_fi....

   Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).

After conducting an inspection of the facility, the Health Inspector calculates a score based on the violations observed. Violations can fall into:high risk category: records specific violations that directly relate to the transmission of food borne illnesses, the adulteration of food products and the contamination of food-contact surfaces.moderate risk category: records specific violations that are of a moderate risk to the public health and safety.low risk category: records violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to the public health and safety.The score card that will be issued by the inspector is maintained at the food establishment and is available to the public in this dataset.

Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection to Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

d43634ad-8dd5-44ce-9a51-b47ed2870a20,Data from: Variation in genome size and karyotype among closely-related aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae),"We measured genome sizes and determined the karyotypes of nine species of aphid parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus. We found large differences in genome size and karyotype between Aphelinus species, which is surprising given the similarity in their morphology and life history. Genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry were larger for species in the mali complex than those for the species in the daucicola and varipes complexes. Haploid karyotypes of the daucicola and mali complexes comprised five metacentric chromosomes of similar size, whereas those of the varipes complex had four chromosomes, including a larger and a smaller metacentric chromosome and two small acrocentric chromosomes or a large metacentric and three smaller acrocentric chromosomes. Total lengths of female haploid chromosome sets correlated with genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry. Phylogenetic analysis of karyotypic variation revealed a chromosomal fusion together with pericentric inversions in the common ancestor of the varipes complex and further pericentric inversions in the clade comprising Aphelinus kurdjumovi and Aphelinus hordei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 28S ribosomal DNA probe revealed a single site on chromosomes of the haploid karyotype of Aphelinus coreae. The differences in genome size and total chromosome length between species complexes matched the phylogenetic divergence between them.
   Materials and Methods
   Specimens
   The parasitoid species studied and the sources of the colonies are listed in the data file ""Aphelinus_species_studied.csv"". These colonies were reared on aphids at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, in Newark, Delaware, USA. Females of the yellow-white strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830) (stock number 1495, obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu) were used as internal controls for flow cytometry. All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.
   Flow cytometry
   Live Aphelinus were sexed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. To estimate genome sizes, we used the flow cytometry protocol described by Hanrahan and Johnston (2011) and Hare and Johnston (2011). We dissected heads from both males and females of the Aphelinus species in cold Galbraith buffer (Galbraith et al. 1983). Heads of female D. melanogaster were used as internal standards (1C = 175 Mb or 0.17 pg). To release the nuclei from cells, 15 female Aphelinus heads and one female Drosophila head, were ground together in one milliliter of cold Galbraith buffer using 15 strokes of the ""A"" pestle in a 2-ml Kontes Dounce tissue grinder. Three to six replicates were done for females and males of each species, but because male genome sizes were too close to that of Drosophila, we used heads from females of the same parasitoid species as internal standards for males. The samples were passed through a 35 micron filter and then stained with 40 parts per million of propidium iodide in the dark for 3-5 hours at 4°C. Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer with laser excitation at 488 nm. Red fluorescence from the propidium iodide was detected using an FL2 filter. The haploid content of DNA in megabases (Mb) was calculated for each Aphelinus sample from the ratio of mean fluorescence of the sample to mean fluorescence of the standard times the genome size of the standard. We report genome size estimates in megabases, but also give estimates in picograms (pg) calculated by dividing the amount of DNA in Mb by the standard 1C value of 978 Mb.
   Karyotypes
   Chromosome preparations were made from cerebral ganglia of prepupae using a modified version of the technique in Imai et al. (1988). Wasps were dissected in 0.5% hypotonic sodium citrate solution containing 0.005% colchicine, and the tissues were incubated in fresh solution for ~30 minutes at room temperature. The material was transferred to a pre-cleaned microscope slide using a Pasteur pipette and gently flushed with Fixative I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol: distilled water 3:3:4). Tissues were disrupted in an additional drop of Fixative I using dissecting needles. Another drop of Fixative II (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol 1:1) was then applied to the center of the area and blotted off the edges of the slide. The slide was air dried for ~30 minutes at room temperature. For conventional staining, preparations were stained with freshly prepared 3% Giemsa solution in 0.05M Sørensen's phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4 + KH2PO4, pH 6.8). Mitotic divisions were studied and photographed using an optic microscope Zeiss Axioskop 40 FL fitted with a digital camera AxioCam MRc (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To obtain karyograms, the resulting images were processed with image analysis programs: Zeiss AxioVision version 3.1 and Adobe Photoshop version 8.0. Mitotic chromosomes were measured for 5-19 cells in 1-4 wasps per species using Adobe Photoshop. We report total length of all chromosomes in each karyotype; for diploid sets, we divided total length by two to make the values comparable to haploid sets. We also report relative lengths (RL; 100 x length of each chromosome divided by total length of the set) and centromeric indices (CI; 100 x length of shorter arm divided by total length of a chromosome). Chromosomes were classified into metacentric (M) or acrocentric (A) according to the guidelines in Levan et al. (1964).",Data from: Variation in genome size and karyotype among closely-related aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/d43634ad-8dd5-44ce-9a51-b47ed2870a20) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),USDA NAL,"[""aphelinidae"",""aphelinus"",""flow-cytometry"",""genome-size"",""karotype"",""np304"",""parasitoid""]","[""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture""]","[""c177e3b21c64de17c00b6a666bd010d594935a94f2ae0a3023f190663fb0c38e.text.csv"",""f08b41e78c6f97fad1211ea687460a408adaa74041e7521a378db2ccb0390fb5.text.csv"",""84a688e78f94df624a2c67b4200786f82b5e767cdce2b316712d1ca3e5e3e071.text.csv"",""9dddeb60d28fe81e66c1e17150a95693511b8ed284cc667106ea8a5cb90f6308.text.csv""]",84a688e78f94df624a2c67b4200786f82b5e767cdce2b316712d1ca3e5e3e071.text.csv,"['country', 'address', 'region', 'rank', 'ranking']","['complex', 'species', 'waspID', 'cellID', 'total_length (�m)']"

Viral hemorrhagic fevers, Machupo virus to Viral hemorrhagic fevers, Sabia virus - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.
Note:
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.
Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
 Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_fi....
   † Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).
   § Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as ""viral hemorrhagic fevers'.

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states or territory.
   Note:
   This table contains provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.

e199710f-bba4-422a-aa05-a7a1310779dd,"Data from: Switchgrass cultivar, yield, and nutrient removal responses to harvest timing","Finite nutrients, such as P and K are assumedly remobilized post-senescence in herbaceous feedstocks like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a function of environmental signaling and genotype. Harvesting early during the maturation phase may result in yield reductions and higher nutrient removal in biomass depending on ecotype. Therefore, it is necessary to target harvest dates that optimize yield while minimizing nutrient removal per cultivar. Consequently, objectives were to compare yields from 2010–2011 on eight widely used and experimental upland and lowland genotype (whole plot) at two locations in Tennessee, to determine: (i) which harvest timing (split-plot) provides maximum yield; (ii) effects of harvest timing (mid-September, October, November, and late October) on overall total P and K removal; and, (iii) how results are affected by cultivar. Among all post-senescence harvests, yields peaked early November (13.2 Mg ha–1), which was greater than all other harvests (P [HTML_REMOVED] 0.05), with mid-October and late October not differing from one another. Because yields peaked in early November, P and K removal did not vary across harvest dates (despite both P and K concentrations declining mid-October). Lowland cultivars yielded 3.9 Mg ha–1 more biomass annually than upland entries, suggesting lowland cultivars are better suited to environments in the Southeast. Due to lower yields, P and K removals were lower for upland (Blackwell and C62), compared with lowland cultivars. Consequently, switchgrass can be harvested as early as mid-September without removing greater amounts of P and K, although variations within upland and lowland cultivars will likely occur.","Data from: Switchgrass cultivar, yield, and nutrient removal responses to harvest timing (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/e199710f-bba4-422a-aa05-a7a1310779dd) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",USDA NAL,"[""feedstocks"",""np212"",""nutrient-remobilization"",""post-senescence""]","[""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture""]","[""256ac8b3531378ba9d301a61466d6ee73736f2587e8a519909bcf4d0149768f8.text.csv"",""c2fb75ca0ae47b2ea29a2a5264b5463ab666eb0e2b066740bb1a79fb38d78be5.text.csv""]",256ac8b3531378ba9d301a61466d6ee73736f2587e8a519909bcf4d0149768f8.text.csv,"['sex', 'age', 'code', 'rank', 'address', 'region', 'status', 'rank', 'rank']","['Year', 'Lab ID', 'Variety', 'Plot', 'Loc', 'Date', 'tissue ', 'P', 'K']"

   Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).
   Age groups for childhood death rates are based on age at death.

fa59eec8-5073-4b63-b1fd-ff3f891d00d7,Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species collected from soybean aphid in Asia,"The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is native to Asia where it is an occasional pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.). Aphis glycines was found during 2000 in North America and since then has spread throughout much of the area where soybean is grown. In Asia, A. glycines seldom reaches damaging levels; however in North America, it has become the most important insect pest of soybean, decreasing yields and incurring large control costs. Field surveys and exclosure experiments in China showed that natural enemies can limit soybean aphid abundance. A project to find, evaluate, and introduce Asian natural enemies into North America was initiated in 2001, with an emphasis on parasitoids. To ensure that introductions of exotic parasitoids would have minimum impact on non-target species, we tested host specificity of all candidates for introduction. These data sets provide results of no-choice laboratory experiments on host specificity of 13 populations in seven species from three species complexes in the genus Aphelinus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). They also provide results of experiments on the mechanisms of host specificity in three parasitoid species with narrow host ranges.",Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species collected from soybean aphid in Asia (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fa59eec8-5073-4b63-b1fd-ff3f891d00d7) is licensed under CC0 1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),USDA NAL,"[""aphelinus-asychis-complex"",""aphelinus-coreae"",""aphelinus-glycinis"",""aphelinus-mali-complex"",""aphelinus-rhamni"",""aphelinus-varipes-complex"",""biological-control"",""np304"",""soybean-aphid""]","[""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture"",""Department of Agriculture""]","[""cfb59093d159bb62cb073be827b4e4488d812891a3c8e54d8753263de6080081.text.csv"",""1394e2239dfe49c57c863b73b56ca000d865c818f19cf79ba03a956e8caf04d9.text.csv"",""489096c99fbd1e5b6785a543d9ac2aac046003f6bfe00569b9138f3ee099d12d.text.csv"",""b5e65f3d41a8d8712cad2b9c31b8419ed55136a4ab75fe5dd51cc6e0008a5a8b.text.csv"",""67470630d235f3f9f01478091510dd736051b34c568b7f3c633f2689f7c2bf8e.text.csv"",""a9f89948656cf814371ba85a9c555179d0bb007fc9f565526de6b1c9a97871c5.text.csv"",""a9e8a67e7109e53c9793d1850625e4261755ffab181c67186178c4ae748a7628.text.csv"",""681880d6d6e163aa52ffd9d75b188030405686f65e69a14a8ac0aa1608c2a321.text.csv"",""7d78f8cfd29e9fb6c4b15c59514945e1366de849ca8836ccdbcb36574db22143.text.csv"",""2a832bbc7290a55e5c8459c9f0235a7348ecd02e06679f5efb7dd718bce03dea.text.csv"",""4bc297613f29af9e0955284b0e528c0db4988c66d1fcfdf78635e22cfcecc39b.text.csv"",""5a391c2e6f5312c040889b52dbf34ce2f6cda836a0175075a09020e0d670a24a.text.csv""]",b5e65f3d41a8d8712cad2b9c31b8419ed55136a4ab75fe5dd51cc6e0008a5a8b.text.csv,"['address', 'country', 'address', 'year', 'address', 'address', 'position', 'day', 'rank', 'type', 'address', 'duration', 'address', 'duration', 'album', 'status', 'plays', 'plays', 'plays', 'plays', 'plays']","['species', 'country', 'city', 'year', 'orighost', 'sourceid', 'subculture', 'block', 'location', 'exphost', 'datein', 'timein', 'dateout', 'timeout', 'waspfate', 'plantfate', 'nmum', 'nemer', 'nadults', 'nmales', 'nfemales']"
